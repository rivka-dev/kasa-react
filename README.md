# Create a real estate rental web application with React
Kasa has been in the business of renting apartments between individuals for almost 10 years now. With more than 500 advertisements posted every day, Kasa is one of the leaders in the rental of apartments between individuals in France.
## Script
Kasa is recruiting you as a freelance front-end developer to develop its new web platform.
### Missions
Start the React project and develop the whole application, the React components, the React Router routes, following the Figma mockups (responsive!) and all the info I give you below. And this with a quality code!
### Design
Here are the [models on Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/bAnXDNqRKCRRP8mY2gcb5p/UI-Design-Kasa-FR?node-id=3%3A0) for the interface design.

### Functional constraints
A few details on the features of the site :  
    1. For scrolling photos in the gallery (Gallery component) :  
        - If the user is at the first image and clicks on "Previous image", the gallery displays the last image.  
        - Conversely, when the image displayed is the last in the gallery, if the user clicks on "Next image", the gallery displays the first image.  
        - If there is only one image, the "Next" and "Previous" buttons as well as the numbering do not appear.  
    2. The gallery must always remain the same height, that indicated on the Figma model. The images will therefore be cropped and centered within the image frame.  
    3. Collapse: By default, Collapses are closed on page initialization.   
    4. If the Collapse is open, the user's click closes it.
        Conversely, if the Collapse is closed, a click opens it.  



# Getting Started with Create React 

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
